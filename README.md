# Activism Website

## Single page static website that advocates and educates users of resources on the significance of youth development in New York City.

As part of CodePath's WEB 101 course-long project with the topic of social impact  for good, I created a single webpage outlining the importance and challenges of developing the next generation of leaders in New York City. Learning and using my HTML, CSS, and Javascript abilities allowed me to incorporate crucial functions that add depth to my webpage. Some significant essential aspects are:

* __Toggable Dark-Mode__
* __Form validation__
* __User-scroll Animation__
* __Popup-style Animated Modal__
