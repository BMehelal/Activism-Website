# Activism Website

## Single page static website that advocates and educates users of resources on the significance of youth development in New York City.

As part of CodePath's WEB 101 course-long project with the theme of social impact for good, I developed a single webpage that highlights the importance and issues in fostering the next generation of leaders in New York City. From learning and implmenting my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I was able to implement key functionalities that gives my webpage some depth. Some notable key features include:

* Toggable Dark-Mode 
* Form validation
* User-scroll Animation 
* Popup-style Animated Modal
