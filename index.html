  <p class = "text-wrapper about_item1">The purpose of my website is to create awareness and serve as a centralized place for people of all ages, not just the youth, to illustrate the involvement of the youth and to establish a new rise of leaders within New York City. Youth is the future of the world, and it is necessary that we support them and give them the opportunity to grow and learn in a productive environment. My website will serve as a one-stop shop where parents and adolescents can look at different programs, NYC based, that will suit their needs the most and encourage the most development to them. </p>     </div>

          The Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP) strives to provide young individuals with a springboard into the job market, but it grapples with funding limitations. Yearly, SYEP fields an overwhelming 156,000 applications while having room for just 90,000 hopeful youths. New York City's low-income students find themselves disproportionately steered towards career-oriented and technical avenues. The city's youth face the challenges of school segregation, which profoundly impacts their prospects. This issue is particularly stark for low-income minority students, who grapple with unequal access to job training and educational resources. SYEP offers a transformative spring and summer program, affording students aged 14-24 invaluable paid job opportunities and hands-on workforce experience. It serves as a lifeline for those young individuals contending with various life challenges, offering them the chance to gain both experience and income. This is especially crucial since obtaining working papers can be a daunting task at times. SYEP caters to a diverse group, including homeless or runaway youth, those entangled in the justice system, and youths in or aging out of foster care. It also supports young individuals from families receiving preventive services through NYC's Administration for Children's Services (ACS).
